Some about me. I'm Junior Developer. I'm 17y/o. From Kyrgyzstan.
I can use HTMl,CSS and also I'm teaching JavaScript. I am very friendly,
but only with people that I think are quite good. I happen really impatient
and curious, but I do not consider it a disadvantage. 
Do not know whether to write. I think 
I've told everything about myself. I do not think my life is
boring because every day confronted with something new and 
interesting for me. For example: meeting new people at school 
or a meeting with the best friends.
